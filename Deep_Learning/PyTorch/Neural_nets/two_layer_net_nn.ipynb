        "\nPyTorch: nn\n-----------\n\nA fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer, trained to predict y from x\nby minimizing squared Euclidean distance.\n\nThis implementation uses the nn package from PyTorch to build the network.\nPyTorch autograd makes it easy to define computational graphs and take gradients,\nbut raw autograd can be a bit too low-level for defining complex neural networks;\nthis is where the nn package can help. The nn package defines a set of Modules,\nwhich you can think of as a neural network layer that has produces output from\ninput and may have some trainable weights.\n\n"
