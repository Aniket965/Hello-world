I love the world and the things in it. 
I love the way cheetah runs.
I hate pollution.
I love the work of god.
I love the beauty of this world.
I adore the way people try solve hard things.
I am nothing but a blade of grass.
I will unleash a lot of prophecies and will bring down hordes of legions unto this earth to destroy you.
I love doing things in a peculiar way.
I love and hate probability. It is so stupid and fun at the same time.
I love the way software programs work.
I love my room.
