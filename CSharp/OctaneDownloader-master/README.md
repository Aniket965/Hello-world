A high Performance C# file downloader that splits files into different parts and downloads each part asyncrounously. Made as a replacement to Microsoft's WebClient.Wanna see the library in action? Check out [Octane YouTube Extractor](https://github.com/gregyjames/OCTANE-YoutubeExtractor)

The progress bar was implemented using my csharp-wrapper for [cpptqdm](https://github.com/aminnj/cpptqdm). It can be found [here](https://github.com/gregyjames/csharp-tqdm)
