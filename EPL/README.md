# Easy Programming Language

**Easy Programming Language** (**EPL**, [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language): 易语言) is a Chinese [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), featuring a full Chinese environment. Its community may be the largest of all [non-English-based programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages). EPL is somewhat popular in China, considering the difficulties of adopting English for most Chinese speakers.
