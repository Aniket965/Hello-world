<h1>Humans vs. Machines: An AI Odyssey</h1>
<p>By <em>Christopher Watkins</em></p>
<em>March 10, 2016</em>
<p><b><i>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!***</i></b> In this, the
third in our series on the epic Go matches being played between AlphaGo
(Google’s Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go
World Champion), we look at the history of Humans vs. Machines, and the
innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.</p>

<p>For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the
implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and
ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or
2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision
come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the
fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a
“computer with a mind of its own” is<s> going to take over the world</s> not
such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</p>
<strong>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</strong>
<p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine
competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve
created speaks to something very deep within our collective
consciousness. When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov<sup>1</sup>,
the event resulted in more than <a href ="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/"> three billion
impressions</a> around the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged the
champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the
proceedings.</p>
<strong> DeepMind’s AlphaGo</strong>
<p>Taking place right now, there is an
event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in
fact have far greater implications when it comes to the future of
“intelligent” machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing
system know as AlphoGo (built by researchers at DeepMind—a Google
Artificial Intelligence lab) began<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/"> a five-game
match </a>against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in the world at the
ancient game of Go.</p>
<p> Why is this so significant?</p>
<p> Here is how the DeepMind
team explained it in their paper <a href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf">Mastering the Game of Go with Deep
Neural Networks and Tree
Search:</a>
<p><i><strong>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic
games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space and
the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</strong></i></p>
<p> Put another way,winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create
machines that can “think” on their own, because success at this uniquely
complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge,
and experience. It requires intuition. Feel. Style. Characteristics we
associate with humans, not with machines.</p>

<p> While AlphaGo is stepping back from competitive play, it's certainly not the end of their work with the Go community, to which they owe a huge debt of gratitude for their encouragement and motivation over the past few years. <p>
