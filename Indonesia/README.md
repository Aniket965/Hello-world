# Republic of Indonesia

This directory is intended for writing "hello world" in programming language using languages in the Indonesia :)


Hey you, Just wanna let you know.
If now you asking people with *Do you speak Bahasa?*, this question is not right.
The correct question should be *Do you speak Bahasa Indonesia?*.

Because if you using `Do you speak bahasa?` this is same as `do you speak *language*?` :)
