# This is a comment!

# We can use comments to explain the code we are writing

# Comments are not documentation, but can be used for local clarification in code

# Here is a statement that prints to the R console
print('This will be printed!')

# it doesn't matter if we use single (') or double (") quoutes for strings
print("Hello World!")
